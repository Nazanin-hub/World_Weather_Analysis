# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

PlanMyTrip is a top travel technology company that specializes in Internet related services in the hotel and Jack is a head of analysis for the user interface team. I helped him to filter the data for the weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.Then, from the list of potential travel destinations, I choosed four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## Results
